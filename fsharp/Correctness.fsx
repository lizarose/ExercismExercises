(* Correctness - How to Write Compile Time Unit Tests*)

(*
    -should be able to look at code and easily read and understand it
    F# Features to Ensure Correctness:
        -immutability --> code behaves more predictable
        -exhaustive pattern matching --> traps common errors at compile
        -strict type system --> check instant compile unit tests
        -expressive type system --> make illegal states unprepresentable
